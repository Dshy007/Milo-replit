How the Excel Data Works
1. Amazon Tender File (CSV/Excel)
Amazon provides you with a weekly schedule showing:
Block ID (e.g., B-BDMP1T4Z8)
Start date/time
End date/time
Origin → Destination (usually LENEXA → LENEXA)
Operator ID (e.g., FTIM_MKC_Solo2_Tractor_4_d2)
2. Milo Maps Blocks to Bench Slots
The system uses the Operator ID and start time to match each Amazon block to your fixed contract slots:
Example:
Plain Text
Block: B-BDMP1T4Z8
Operator: FTIM_MKC_Solo2_Tractor_4_d2
Start: 11/15 08:30 → End: 11/16 22:30
→ Maps to: Solo2, Tractor 4, 08:30 start time
3. Why Static Start Times Matter
✅ Predictability - You know exactly when each tractor needs a driver
✅ Pattern Recognition - The AI can learn which slots consistently run vs. which are sporadic
✅ Driver Planning - Drivers know their schedule in advance (e.g., "I'm on Solo1 Tractor 9, always 16:30 starts")
✅ Compliance - Built-in gaps between start times ensure 10-hour rest periods
✅ Cross-Training - You can move drivers between similar start times (±2 hours) without breaking the bench
4. The "Friday View" Problem Milo Solves
Every Friday, you receive Amazon's schedule showing:
Trips (top section) - drivers currently out on the road from last week
Blocks (bottom section) - new work starting this week, sitting on the "bench"
Manual Problem: You had to:
Figure out which drivers are finishing their trips
Calculate their rest periods
Match them to available bench blocks
Ensure no DOT violations (6-day limit, 34-hour resets)
Track Solo1 vs Solo2 assignments
Milo's Solution:
Reads the Excel file automatically
Separates Trips from Blocks
Tracks driver history and fatigue
Suggests optimal assignments
Flags compliance risks
Generates the final schedule in driver-friendly format: "TIME SOLO1/SOLO2 - DATE"
Example Week (Nov 15-22)
From your actual data:
Total blocks: 81
Solo1 blocks: 58 (80%) - single-day coverage
Solo2 blocks: 23 (20%) - two-day coverage
Busiest day: Saturday 11/15 (29 blocks)
Peak start times: 20:30 (20 blocks), 16:30 (18 blocks)
All 81 blocks align perfectly with your bench contract times - no off-bench anomalies like 09:40 starts, which means clean, predictable scheduling.
Business Impact
Before Milo:
Manual Excel analysis every Friday (hours of work)
Risk of DOT violations from miscalculations
Difficulty scaling beyond 25 drivers
Constant back-and-forth with you to refine schedules
With Milo:
Automated analysis (seconds)
Built-in compliance checking
Scales to 600+ drivers
AI handles routine questions ("Who's available for Solo2 on Monday?")
You focus on strategy, not spreadsheets
Current Status
The system is functionally complete and was packaged for deployment to Replit. The core logic is validated and working. What we're discussing now is making the AI component self-sufficient so users can interact with Milo directly without you needing to manually intervene or burn through Manus credits for every refinement.
