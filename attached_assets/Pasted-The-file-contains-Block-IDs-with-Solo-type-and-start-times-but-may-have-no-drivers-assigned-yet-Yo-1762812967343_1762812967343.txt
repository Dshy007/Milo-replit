The file contains Block IDs with Solo type and start times, but may have no drivers assigned yet. Your job is to understand the rolling-6 day pattern and report what to look for in the file so I can safely assign drivers.

My rules (lock these in)

Time zone: All times are Central (CT).

Contracts (bench): Fixed start times by Solo and tractor. Do not group identical times; each time+tractor is its own contract.

Solo1 (14h): 00:30 (Tractor_8), 01:30 (Tractor_6), 16:30 (Tractor_1), 16:30 (Tractor_9), 17:30 (Tractor_4), 18:30 (Tractor_7), 20:30 (Tractor_10), 20:30 (Tractor_2), 20:30 (Tractor_3), 21:30 (Tractor_5)

Solo2 (38h): 08:30 (Tractor_4), 11:30 (Tractor_6), 15:30 (Tractor_5), 16:30 (Tractor_7), 18:30 (Tractor_1), 21:30 (Tractor_3), 23:30 (Tractor_2)

Block ID: Immutable. One block = one fixed time window.

Durations for math: Solo1 = 14h, Solo2 = 38h. Compute end = start + duration (elapsed hours, ignore DST quirks).

Rolling-6 definition: Count duty days on a sliding window of 6 consecutive calendar days (cross-week):

Solo1 = 1 duty day (the calendar day it starts).

Solo2 = 2 duty days (the start day and the next calendar day).

Friday files include carryovers: The CSV for the new week also shows Fri/Sat from the previous week. Keep those to compute rolling-6 correctly.

Bump logic (for later driver assignment): Start-time flex ±2h (±3h if explicitly marked “last day”). Same-slot + same-solo next cycle is auto-OK on 10-hour rest.

On-bench vs off-bench (only WARN):

off_bench (non_contract_time) → start time not in the contract list for that Solo.

off_bench (wrong_tractor_for_contract) → time is valid but paired with a tractor that’s not in the contract mapping for that time.

Protected drivers (for later when drivers are added):

Isaac Kiragu: no Fridays (hard).

Firas IMAD Tahseen: Sat/Sun/Mon, Solo1 @ 16:30, flex ≤ 17:30 latest.

Tareef THAMER Mahdi: Sat/Sun, Solo1 @ 17:30, never later than 17:30.

Never take blocks from Firas or Tareef to cover others.

What to look for in the CSV

Expect columns like:

Block ID (e.g., B-XXXXXXXXX)

Solo Type (Solo1 or Solo2)

Block Start Date (YYYY-MM-DD)

Start Time (Facility Local) (HH:MM, 24h)

Operator ID (e.g., FTIM_MKC_Solo2_Tractor_7_d2) → parse Solo type + Tractor; ignore the _d# suffix.

Driver Name (may be empty in this file)

Tasks (no mutations—analysis only)

Read the CSV and normalize times to CT. Build a list of blocks:

{block_id, solo_type, start_date, start_time, tractor, start_dt, end_dt}


If tractor isn’t explicit, derive it from Operator ID (e.g., Tractor_7).

Bench alignment report

For each block, check (solo_type, start_time, tractor) against the contract lists above.

Emit:

✅ on_bench

⚠️ off_bench with reason: "non_contract_time" or "wrong_tractor_for_contract", and include expected_tractors when applicable.

Carryover recognition

Treat rows dated Fri/Sat from the previous week as carryover context (label carryover_trip if the row is a trip row tied to a prior Block ID). Keep them for rolling-6 math; do not off-bench-check them.

Unassigned count

Count blocks with no Driver Name that are not carryovers. Provide totals by Solo1/Solo2 and overall.

Rolling-6 readiness map (structure-only)

Build a calendar heatmap (per day) of how many duty days the structure would impose once drivers are assigned:

Solo1 contributes 1 duty day on its start day.

Solo2 contributes 2 duty days: start day and start day + 1.

Output per-day totals for the CSV’s date span (including prior Fri/Sat). This shows pressure zones where drivers might hit rolling-6 limits after assignment.

Output format

Summary:

Total blocks; Solo1 vs Solo2 counts.

Unassigned counts (by Solo type and overall).

Off-bench counts broken down by reason.

Dates present (show Fri/Sat carryover dates explicitly).

Details:

List of off_bench items with block_id, solo_type, start_time, tractor, reason, and expected_tractors (if reason = wrong_tractor_for_contract).

Per-day duty-day projection (a small table) showing how many duty days the structure implies each calendar day (Solo1 adds 1; Solo2 adds on D and D+1).

Notes for dispatcher:

“This is structure-only. Actual rolling-6 violations are per-driver once assignments are added. Use this map to place drivers where daily duty-day pressure is lower.”

Acceptance criteria

Do not group identical start times; handle each time+tractor separately (e.g., Solo1 20:30 appears for Tractor_10, Tractor_2, Tractor_3 — list all three).

Treat off-bench as WARN only (not errors). Use reason codes.

Include the Fri/Sat carryover dates in the duty-day projection.

The output must be clear, plain language, with one compact JSON summary at the end.
